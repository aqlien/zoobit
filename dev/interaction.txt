Happiness = master value
  energy = when high, happier, play takes it down but gives a big happiness boost
  fullness = when high, pet is happy but feeding doesn't do anything (or decreases happiness?)
  love = time since last interaction

  happiness:


  energy increases slowly when not interacting
  feeeing gives a small energy boost and resets hunger completely
  fullness decreases constantly, at a pace so that the pet needs to be fed twice daily





  Idea for future -
  once full, energy starts filling a boredom bar, which decreases happiness.
