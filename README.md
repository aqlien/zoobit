ZooBit is a web app that allows users to manage
their own collection of virtual pets. These pets require
interaction with their user in order to stay happy, and
their image will change based on the current level of happiness.

Pets are adopted from the shelter, and if a user chooses not to keep their pet
it will be returned to the shelter, able to be adopted by another user.

#To Do
Version 2 will focus on adding more attributes affecting pet's happiness, and more ways for the user to interact with the pets in order to raise the various attribute levels. V2 will also add pet behavior in the form of random pet actions/status updates ("Your pet is sleeping.", "Your pet went through your trash can!", "Your pet is feeling sick.", "Your pet is staring at you." etc.)
