#About

ZooBit is a web app that allows users to manage
their own collection of virtual pets. These pets require
interaction with their user in order to stay happy, and
their image will change based on the current level of happiness.

Pets are adopted from the shelter, and if a user chooses not to keep their pet
it will be returned to the shelter, able to be adopted by another user.

#To Do
The next version will focus on improving the user experience, including making pets more interactive.
