ZooBit is a web app that allows users to manage
their own collection of virtual pets. These pets require
interaction with their user in order to stay happy, and
their image will change based on the current level of happiness.

Version 1 will focus on basic functionality concerning keeping multiple pets, pet happiness levels, and maintaining pet happiness through user interaction.

Version 2 will focus on adding more attributes besides happiness to pets (hunger, energy, etc.) and more ways for the user to interact with the pets in order to raise the various attribute levels. v2 will also add pet behavior in the form of random pet actions/status updates ("Your pet is sleeping.", "Your pet went through your trash can!", "Your pet is feeling sick.", "Your pet is staring at you." etc.)
